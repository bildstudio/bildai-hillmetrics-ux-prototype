**So that** I can automatically process data received via email without manual intervention  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System email address `data-intake@mind-hillmetric.com` accepts emails with attachments
- Supported attachment formats: CSV, Excel (.xlsx, .xls), JSON, XML, PDF
- Maximum attachment size: 25MB per email, 100MB total per day per sender
- Email subject becomes flux name (e.g., "Daily Sales Report 2024-01-15")
- Email body text becomes flux description
- Sender email must be whitelisted in system
- Auto-reply confirmation sent within 30 seconds of receipt
- Duplicate detection based on filename + sender + timestamp (within 1 hour window)

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
interface EmailFluxRequest {
  senderEmail: string;
  subject: string;
  bodyText: string;
  attachments: Array<{
    filename: string;
    mimeType: string;

  receivedAt: Date;
}
```

**Validation Rules:**
